# üõí Amazon E-Commerce SQL Database Project (Oracle SQL)

## üìò Overview

This project simulates a **mini Amazon-like e-commerce database system** built entirely using **Oracle SQL**.
It demonstrates how to manage, query, and analyze relational data for customers, products, orders, and payments ‚Äî all using real-world business logic.

## üß± Database Structure

### üìÇ Tables Created

1. **Customers** ‚Äì Stores customer information
2. **Products** ‚Äì Stores product details
3. **Orders** ‚Äì Stores order transactions
4. **OrderItems** ‚Äì Stores items within each order
5. **Payments** ‚Äì Stores payment records for orders

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Schema

| Table          | Columns                                                            | Description                          |

| **Orders**     | order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount                    | Order information linked to customer |
| **OrderItems** | order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price               | Items inside each order              |
| **Payments**   | payment_id, order_id, payment_method, payment_status, payment_date | Payment records for orders           |

## üì¶ Sample Data

* 5 Customers
* 5 Products
* 5 Orders
* 5 OrderItems
* 5 Payments

> Total Records: **25 rows** across 5 tables

The data represents a mini Amazon-style dataset with real-world categories such as Electronics, Fashion, and Computers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run (Oracle SQL)

1. Open **Oracle SQL Developer** or **SQL*Plus**
2. Create a new connection (with your Oracle DB user)
3. Copy and run the SQL file in this order:

   * Table Creation
   * Data Insertion
   * Queries
4. Commit your changes:

   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```
5. Run each query individually to view results.
